# studyup

A webapp we made for our CMSC 126 (Web Engineering) class 22-hour hackathon. The theme was making UP Cebu better. Studyup is a platform where UP Cebu students could upload their class notes to share, to be downloaded by other fellow students. Hopefully, this will encourage students to collaborate and study more often.
